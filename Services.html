                Unity is my hammer, but I bring a whole toolbox. Unity is powerful, flexible, and ideal for rapid iteration. I use it across platforms including mobile, AR/VR, and desktop, and regularly work with systems like DOTween, Unity’s new Input System, Addressables, and build/release pipelines. From understanding the real problem and listening to stakeholder needs, to designing flexible, stable, and testable systems with integrated diagnostics, I aim to deliver solutions that are not just functional but well-suited to the long-term vision of the project.

                        Prototyping UI from Figma designs, iterating with player feedback, and supporting accessibility are key parts of my workflow. I see user experience as deeply connected to game design, it’s not just about interface polish, but how the product feels from the first moment to the lasting impression. A good UX considers not just interaction but also the player’s expectations, identity, and the emotional arc throughout their journey.

                I've mentored junior developers and students in Unity and game design. Helping others grow has deepened my own understanding of clean architecture, debugging, and design systems. Each person brings a unique background, which often means diving into obscure topics and gaining fresh insights and perspectives in return.

                        Programming is essentially translating requirements and
                        defining clear rules. Once you've written a game manual
                        and cleared up any ambiguities, you're well equipped to
                        write a manual for an application. Mastering tools and
                        programming languages is critical, but even more
                        important is working in agile teams that send you on a
                        journey that has growth built right into it.

                        Learning the basics of game design and developing a
                        common language are valuable, but most importantly are
                        techniques and problem-solving skills that a true game
                        designer needs. Balancing entire game systems and

                        Being truly agile means adapting to the needs of the
                        team, the tech stack, and the product. Good
                        communication and constant honest feedback are at the
                        heart of agile development. Leading reviews, retros, and
                        planning sprints require experience in this area.
                        Constantly evaluating and redefining new techniques
                        requires switching between open and closed mindsets to
                        keep improving the team, which is what ultimately
                        matters.
